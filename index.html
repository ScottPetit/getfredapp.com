            <h1>Hey,</h1>

            <p>So it's a little weird to be writing a letter in this digital age right. I thought though that a letter would be the best way for me to introduce myself. <strong>I'm Fred.</strong></p>

            <p>I'm an app that doesn't do everything and doesn't pretend to. I'm an app that does one thing really well and that's all. That's not to say in the future I won't pick up some new skills but right now, in my infancy, I'm only focused on one thing. That one thing is letting people know that you're running late as fast and as easy as possible.</p>

            <p>You might be asking yourself why you would even want an app that does that. First off if you're running late, it's just the right thing to do to let the people that are <em>waiting on you</em> know that you didn't forget about them.  Second you're busy right, you wouldn't be running late to meetings if you weren't busy, so why not let them know as fast as possible.  That's it.  That's what I do right now.</p>        
            
            <p>Thanks,</p>
